            A cunning and calculating rat, Ripred is a crucial ally to Gregor and his friends in their fight against the rats of the Underland. Despite his abrasive personality and willingness to use violence, Ripred is also fiercely loyal to those he considers his allies, and he often provides valuable insight and knowledge about the Underland's complex politics and history. Over the course of the series, Ripred's relationships with Gregor and Luxa become increasingly complex and fraught with tension. Ripred is a Rager, which means he has exceptional skill when it comes to fighting and it is shown how he can take on many foes at once with great ease. In the final book, Ripred is thought to be dead for a while (eaten by mites) when he comes back as an ambassador to the Gnawers and Bonds with Luxa to ensure peace.
