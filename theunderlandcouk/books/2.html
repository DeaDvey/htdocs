        <article>
            Set a few months after the first book, <a href="../chars/gregor.html">Gregor</a> must travel to The Labyrinth to kill The Bane and prevent his little sister, Boots, from being killed by the rats<br/><br/>
            Blurb reads:<br/>
            Months have passed since <a href="../chars/gregor.html">Gregor</a><br/>first fell into the strange Underland beneath New<br/>York City, and he swears he will never go back.<br/>But he is destined to be a key player in another prophecy,<br/>this one about an ominous white rat called the Bane. The<br/>Underlanders know there is only one way to lure <a href="../chars/gregor.html">Gregor</a> back<br/>to their world: by kidnapping his little sister, Boots.<br/><a href="../chars/gregor.html">Gregor</a>'s quest reunites him with his bat, Ares and the<br/>rebellious princess, <a href="../chars/luxa.html">Luxa</a>. They desend into the dangerous<br/>Waterway in search of the Bane. If <a href="../chars/gregor.html">Gregor</a> does not fulfill the<br/>prophecy, his life, and the Underland, will never be the same.
