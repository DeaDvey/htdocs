<h1>Gregor the Overlander Annotations</h1>
<h2>Blurb:</h2>
<blurb>When
  eleven-year-old Gregor<br/>follows his
  little sister through a grate in the<br/>laundry room of their New York
  apartment<br/>building, he hurtles into the dark Underland beneath
  the<br/>City. There, humans live uneasily beside giant spiders,<br/>bats,
  cockroaches, and rats -- but the fragile peace is about<br/>to fall
  apart.<br/>Gregor wants no part of a conflict. He just wants to<br/>find his
  way home. But when he discoveres that a prophecy<br/>foretells a role for
  him in the Underland's future, he realizes<br/>it might be the only way to
  solve the biggest mystery of his<br/>life. Little does he know his quest
  will change him -- and<br/>the Underland -- forever<br/><hr/></blurb>

    <td>Suzanne Collins uses an extended metaphour of Gregor being a caveman
    here. Could this allude to how he sees the Underlanders as prehistoric and
    is embarrased by Vikus later on?  Or perhaps just his teenage instinctual
      actions?</td>
