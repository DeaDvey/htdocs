They reside on flat land and have a large population as to protect the whole area, as one Crawler on their own are very weak, Crawlers have wings but rarely use them and worship &&Boots&& (Gregor's sister) as their princess.
Notable Crawlers include:<br/>
&&Temp&&<br/>
    -&&Boots&&' protector throughout the series<br/>
&&Tick&&<br/>
    -&&Boots&&' protector in the first book, died to save Boots<br/>
Humans and &&Flier&&s commonly mock the &&Crawler&&s for their stupidity and cowardice throughout the books, &&Gregor&& sticks up for them as he is not as accustommed to their ways. They often speak in a odd way where the last part of the speach is repeated at the start eg: "Follow us, you will Follow us"`],

	 ["Gregor the Overlander","Book",`&&Gregor&& follows his sister (&&Boots&&) down the grate in the laundry room of his apartment building and falls miles down to a place called &&The Underland&& where he bumps into giant cockroaches called &&Crawler&&s who take them to the underground human city of &&Regalia&&, where he meats Queen &&Luxa&& and &&Vikus&&. He tries to escape whilst being held prisoner in &&Regalia&& when he meets two ginormous rats called &&Gnawers&& who try to eat him, thankfully, &&Mareth&&, &&Perdita&&, &&Henry&& and &&Luxa&& save his life and bring him back to &&Regalia&& where he learns that he is a Warrior metioned in a prophecy that goes as follows:<br/>
Beware, &&Underlander&&s, time hangs by a thread.<br/>
The hunters are hunted, white water runs red.<br/>
The &&Gnawer&&s will strike to extinguish the rest.<br/>
The hope of the hopeless resides in a quest.<br/>
An Overland warrior, a son of the sun,<br/>
May bring us back light, he may bring us back none.<br/>
But gather your neighbors and follow his call<br/>
Or rats will most surely devour us all.<br/>
Two over, two under, of royal descent,<br/>
Two &&Flyer&&s, two &&Crawler&&s, two &&Spinner&&s assent.<br/>
One &&Gnawer&& beside and one lost up ahead.<br/>
And eight will be left when we count up the dead.<br/>
The last who will die must decide where he stands.<br/>
The fate of the eight is contained in his hands.<br/>
So bid him take care, bid him look where he leaps,<br/>
As life may be death and death life again reaps.<br/>
Eventually, &&Gregor&& is convinced to help with this quest and as soon as the rats start attacking they are on their way to the &&Flier&&s, to get two &&Flier&&s to join their quest. After they have two &&Flier&&s they go to the &&Crawler&&s land to get two &&Crawler&&s, but oddly the &&Crawler&&s start worshipping &&Gregor&&'s sister, &&Boots&& and agree to join the quest. They then go to the &&Spinner&&'s land, unfortunatly, the &&Spinner&&s deny to join the quest and inmprison the adventurers who swiftly manage to escape. After they escape the &&Spinner&&'s lair, &&Vikus&& reveals to the group that him, &&Mareth&&, &&Solovet&& and their &&Flier&&s must leave as the Prophecy only lists two &&Underlander&&s, two &&Flier&&s, two &&Crawler&&s, two &&Spinner&&s, two &&Overlander&&s and one lost up ahead, they also leave them with a new guide called &&Ripred&& a rat who is on the adventures side, it is also revealed that &&Vikus&& is &&Luxa&&'s grandfather. The adventurers head into &&Gnawer&& territory to find &&Gregor&&'s father and &&Henry&& reveals that he is a traitor and a small army of rats attack them, &&Gregor&& realises that the last stanza means that &&Gregor&& must jump off the edge of a cliff, &&Gregor&& jumps off the edge with all the rats following him, they all fall and surprisingly &&Ares&& saves him rather than saving &&Henry&&, his bond (bond means they will always save each others lives)`]
