<h1>An annotation of character names and their meanings</h1>
Most of the Overlander names are quite boring and a lot of the Underlander
name I couldn 't find any meanig to them.<br/>
Anything that says it is a standard name means it is a common name that likely
has no further meaning and Unkown means I have never heard the name nor know
what it means, they are likely random, though a lot of the Underlander ones
are European sounding.
