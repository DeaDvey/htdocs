	I'm so sorry for not updating in 6 days, it's hard to with revision and homework and that, anyways, we had some snow days which gave me an oppurtunity to work on this program that my dad commisioned me to do that scrapes data from this website he uses, it was pretty fun, I had to learn Selenium in Python haha, and I don't use Python much so tyhat was awkward lolz, but anyway, I finished it and it works well, he payed me ¬£200 for it which is epic, I'm that much closer to a gaming PC lol, but anyways, that's all I've done this week other than hoemwork which is of course pretty boring haha so yea bye. Oh right yeah, I also got this game called Ages of Conquest, I already had it on <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a> but the Steam version is so much better (though no longer free :() so yeah, that's pretty fun, I'm simulating a world war right now :P <br/>

	<h3>05-06/03/23</h3>
	Ugh, I didn't update yesterday for a good reason! I went to a concert, it was ABBA Voyage, and it was <b>so</b> good! I think how it works is that they are all on a screen 
and there are fake spotlights within the screen which reflect and is blocked by the fake ABBA which makes them seem 3D, the real lights in the room are never pointed at the screen 
so it doesn't break the illusion. On top of this, there isn't much physically around ABBA meaning your eyes don't have much to compare to, but if you try to look at the on stage 
band and then ABBA, you cna kind of tell that they are 3D, the effect is still really effective though! When the screens zoom into ABBA and they show them up close, you can tell 
that they are CGI and probably motion capture, but you can tell that some of the movements don't seem quite right occasionally, but still, it looks increadibly good, just a few 
things that make it look CGI. I would totally reccomend the concert, it was so fun seeing ABBA even if they weren't real, it felt as though they were. And today I made a searching 
systme on <a href="http://theunderland.co.uk">theunderland.co.uk</a> which you can find <a href="http://theunderland.co.uk/search">here</a> it basically searches through all the 
finished pages, I also carried on making Wordle in JS and that was fun, Oh yeah I got to use some JSON in the search project. I think that's it for today, hopw you all had a good 
day!<br/>

	<h3>28/02-04/03/23</h3>
	It's been a few days, I have been playing Factorio into the DEAD of night haha so I guess that is why it took a few days to update, I'm so sorry, I did have some issues with Factotio where it would boot but I couldn't see the window, what I did was go into KDE (as I use a tiling manager (XMonad)) and load it, then I set it to windowed mode, this fixed the issue as it would boot through steam as windowed in XMonad and worked perfecty fine, one cool thing I found was that there is a window manager thing (like alt-tab in windows) that is installed as import XMonad.Actions.GridSelect which is pretty cool as you can see all open windows across all virtual desktops, anyways, I think that is it for tonite, I think I will <b>try</b> to upload tomorow as well, also go check out my YouTube channel as I uploaded a few new videos there, cya.<br/>

	<h3>1-27/02/23</h3>
	Errrrm yeahh it's been a WHILE, so basically, I recently (like halway through Feb) changed (again) to Xmonad, and it's been a struggle, but fun none the less I guess a fun challenge, I am also now closer to getting a better PC, I emphasise closer cause I'm still really far away... I have also played loads of Trackmania as I started uploading daily Trackmania (and a bit of other stuff) content on my YouTube, which is now a lot more active and I've gained 10 subscribers which is super cool!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-qXye3XcvdZinl-_8m4xQ"> go check it out if you want</a> bu it's not that good, I have been preoccupied by that which is why I haven't updated the blog in NEARLY A MONTH so sorry still, I feel guilty :'( I also am rewatching JoJos bizzare adventure and am on part 4, my favourite part.<br/>
OK, cya later guys, I'm gonna go eat but I promise to update tommorow O.O<br/>

	Ugh, I'm so sorry, I keep forgetting or getting busy, but now I have 47 hours on Dwarf Fortress and I also played a lot of Battlefront, yes all of them, well not the shitty mobile ones, but all the other ones, yesterday I managed to get Battlefront 2 (2017) working but today it doesn't work, each time I load it, the window pops up then it crashes after a few moments, it's really annoying. luckily the good Battlefront 2 (2005) still works yeahhh, I have 53 hours on it now lol.<br/>

	<h3>19-21/01/23</h3>
	Argggaahh so so I haven't updated in a while (not that anyone reads this anyways lol) but I've been focusing a lot on the Bit life clone, there's a lot of different situations that must be programmed, I have currently an outlione of a game and no more, but it can be accessed <a href="/bitlifeClone">here</a> even though it is barely even a game, I will put it on the experiments tab if I think it is worthy, any ways, one coo thing I found out is you can have multiple .js files that can refrence functions in the others (as long as they are both connected to the main .html file) and this is really useful as I can have fnctions that rarely (if ever) change that I can put in one file so it doens't make the main one that I edit a lot all cluttered up if you want to see an example of this then see <a href="/bitlifeClone/staticFuncs.js">this</a> so yeah I think that is... oh wait yeah, I got a forge minecraft server running with a few mods so that's cool, sometimes crashes though :( lol, maybe I didn't allocate enough RAM haha, I'll check tommorow, yeah I think that really is it now. oh yeah, I made a dev mode withc just gives you a lot of money and all the best grades for testing purposes haha, so you can enable it in the console by making the variable "devToolsQuery" equal true, mainly for me but you can use it I don't care lol.<br/>

	<h3>17/01/23</h3>
	I played a bit of BattleFront 2 and OSRS, other than that, I earned some money making Power Points, see, I've decided to save up for a better computer, which would be about ¬£500, so I'm going to do loads of jobs and that, it'll take a while, but I won't buy many Steam games or comics, it'll be difficult :'( but at the end I will hopefully have a PC! that's it for today, it was pretty feautureless haha<br/>

	Bit of a rush, I set up the christmas tree today, getting to the point where I'm in the christmas spirit :D am quite exited now :D, so I also found some old records/viynls when looking in the attic, we set up an electronic record play and it can play music... but really. really. quietly, so to compensate, I put my phone next to it and were pretneding it's coming from the record player. so basically the electronic speaker has no batteries so I ordered some more AAAs and they will arrive tommorow, will update to see if it works, also my USB-C adapter should arrive tommorow and that's pretty fun! I also tried to play the Mindustry server but it's not working, so that's a bummer >:( I sort of gave up, it doens't seem to correspond to the same server anyways, I'm a bit confused as I don't know much about servers and networks D: oooo big thing, I heard whams "Last Christmas" and I cried :'( I'm out of whamageddon2022 noooo :(:(:(:( so annoyed! I got so far this year, ge=uess it was only a matter of time though. welp that's it for today<br/>

	<h3>13/12/22</h3>
	So, one main important, no actually two cool things happened today,first of all, I finally went into the computer shop to get my HDMI slot fixed, I catually went to one, they recomended me another that does more hardware stuf then another that does more intricate things, so we were really walking around XD, not that far thouggh, they were just over the road from each other hhaa, so they couldn't fix it :( but they recomended a DP splitter followed by a DP > HDMI adapter:) , this was ¬£25 but I looked online and found that you can get a USB-C adapter for way cheaper, didn't even know USB-C had the capability :D sp that's been ordered and is on it's way, secondly I found out (after a lot of tribulations) how to remotely connect Emacs to my ssh server, so what I did was ssh to it with C-x f and it works! I am currently using Emacs right this second in fact, so in a ew days (when the adapter arrives) I will be stocked to be editing Wraithfate live and using a second monior so they are not squished together, I am rather exited about the prospect, I also think I will be switching to Brit Box from Disney+ so I can continue watching the classic Dr. Who, all in all, I am very exited, cause oh yeah, it's the winter holdiday starting this weekend!!!! Annnnywayyys...<br/>

				<h3>11-12/12/22</h3>
				I was out late last nigh mfo++ haha, so I found out today that you can edit the css and html so easily with Libre Office Writer and IDK how I feel about it!, Iaccidently ruined the old version of this page (this is a convinient backup) you can actually see the ruined one on the same URL but with a (1) around it haha, IDK why it did that  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø (<-- copy and paste that ;)-->) so anyways that was scary ._. and Also I added UTF-8 to this page so things actually work haha! I guess if you're reading this in the future, first off wow are flying cars neat! and secondly, why? and thirdly this page looked pretty shite sometimes due to NOT having UTF-8 on XD, so I have it now, I did a lot on Wraithfawte and started added the Location Basded Image system ;) you have no clue what that is do you ahhaha, Errrm what else happened IDK, I think I'll look more into this LibreOffice Writer thing, could defo come in handy sometimes ahah, but can also be pretty annoyin :( so anyways,<br/>
				cya, wouldn't wanna beya!

				<h3>10/12/22</h3>
				So, in the morning, I went on a freezing as fuck run, my hands where numb, and the grass was white, it wasn't snow, but FROST, kinda odd, well not really, I just don't leave the house often haha, I had to wear gloves for a third of it lol. I did some of Wraithfate today and that's pretty cool. I do't know what else to say tbh, I tried to get an sftp package working for Emacs cause I can't use it when connecting to remote file:(<br/>

                <h3>09/12/22</h3>
                I think I've pretty much given up on the advent of code, they are too hard, and I'm not a very good coder, mayber next year I will be better, I mean look at the progress I've made this year, not much haha, I'm trying to get windows 10running on a virtual box nad am downloading the iso file right nw, and oh yeah it's the weekend, hooray!!! I will maybe do advent of code still but not keeping up with the days and just do them whenever you know, I got wine working and have Trackmania, and Notepad++plus more working, so that's pretty awesome, I'm downloading WoW right now, bring the addiction back on >:) hhaa<br/>
That's all for today amigos cya! (I need to make a unique signing off phrase)

                    My brain feels metaphoricaly like mushy peas, I did intense coding (not really) today I tried to do the 7th day on adventofcode.com and I'm almost there, but I didn't get it, I also started making my TUC web game, it's okay, but not that good XD, other than those, I haven't done anything much, I played a bit of Minecraft and I carried on building my Massive Maze.<br/>
I'd say that's it fuck, text editor is worse that Notepad!

                I think I forgot to post yesterday whoops, oh yeah, I got back home at about nine so had no time to blog, had to update this other thing and do homework, the 5ths advent was really hard, I finished it today as I had not much time yesterday, but todays was significalntly easier! Also, I saw a YT video, aparently the Tom Scott junction was fixed, I mean, it's good, but I was kinda planning to visit it, so that's a bummer! also, wow killer theme sog, boulevard of broken dreams, okay I forgot what I was gonna say, just listening to Spotifty haha, errrm, I yeah, it's gone lol, okay I guess thats uggg what was it! okay tta's it<br/>

                <h3>04/11/22</h3>
                I didn't do that much today, except oh yeah, I fucking completed all the advent of codes (up to now) that I hadn't already done, that's like 5! so that was a busy morning lmao! I reorganised my desktop so that it shows longer icons on my taskbar and I also have a sidebar and also added a clock onto my desktop haha it took a while and was quite annoying, but I managed to do it! and a bunch of other cool "desklets" so yeah, preeety neat, I had a bit of a problemwith rightclicking the taskbar, but that's gone now, I also made a mega base in mindustry so yeah, it looks pretty good and there is 62K watts per pylon haha!!! it is mental big like wtf!<br/>
                Ok, that's today done, byeee

                <h3>01-03/11/22</h3>
                OMG, I'm so sorry, so on Thurday, I was at the theatre watching The Inspector Calls sp I obviously couldn't update as I got back at half eleven, then on Friday, I found this cool new game called Mindustry and it's so cool! I was playing that late into Friday, and was preoccupied, so couldn't update ._. good explanation... Ok, so Inspector Calls was good, The house fell over at the end so that was odd, and they had to shout at The Inspector from their balconey, it was a bit weird, oh and at one bit, someone collapsed in the audience and they had to stop the play it was scary!, so that's it for today, hope you all had a good end-of-the-week and are looking forward to the Advent Of Code<br/>
                Goodbye.

                Day 1:<br/>
                I went to Harry Potter World today!!! I didn't buy anything but it was so good, I saw the nightbus, and since last time they have added the greenhouses and a fountain! it's really cool! I also had some butter beer and some fries, I went on the hogwarts express and said 'up' to a broom, it was pretty fun! I was wearing my green Slytherin Jumper and when I went on the green screen bit, my top half was invisible XDXD it was really stupid, it looked like I had an invisibility cloak though ahaha I was tempted to buy a choclate frog! We left at like 10PM and we were THE last people to leave XD (apaert from employees ofc) we got back at about 12:15 and it's the next day...<br/>
                    Day 2:<br/>
                    Now it's the midnight right after last log, so I am eating noodles and I decidd to install Linux haha, wow yeah random, but it looks pretty good ok gonna go to bed now, so I woke up and finished installing Linux and it's good, After school, disaster! my PC wont boot up!!! aggaga I can't even get to BIOS nooo, so I took out my D drive and it worked, had to go through a few hoops, but I got Linux working :D I can't use my D drive now grrrr. that was a stressful day!<br/>
                    Day 3:<br/>
                    So I've got Linux working now, right, well for a bit yes, but I tried opening Windows and shock, now it doesn't work, so after school I take out D drive again and it works I also my password isn't working, have to do some hacky wacky to get it back, seems insecure hmm, so that's annoying, I get started on downloading apps for myself, and logging into things, basically getting everything sorted and stuff, I have spotify and Google Maps Pro now! whhooo, okay that's it for today goodbye.
                    <hr/>
                <h3>25-26/11/22</h3>
                I've done ALOT today, firstly, last night I made a Notepad++ file that has every JSFiddle file I've been sent, for future use. This morning though, I have continued making my new Dungeon Crawler better, Oh shit, I didn't do blog yesterday, ok, so yesterday I started making a Dungeon Crawler and today as I said, maid it better, but I didn't blog yesterday as I was watching Haryy Potter, specifically  seven part two, so that was fun, love the ending, I'm going to Harry Potter World on Sunday (London One) and I'm hyped haha, so today, I continued Dungeon Crawler (has no name) and it's going okay, I have also updated the home page, made it more sleek, though still pretty bad >:( I have also made a new Git Hub repository for useful code and have made an <a href="allPages.html"> all pages page</a> and it looks good, it's a catalouge of all the pages in the primary directory, so yay,I did ParkRun and got a 29:48 so that was good for me :) I watched a ton on Batman 1966-68 series and also some Mr Bean, it's so funny haha, (live action > animated change my mind) and yeah damn I'd thought I'd done more, this always happens in an action packed day >:( oh yeah, I added a bunch of photos to <a href="photosStuff">Photos page</a> and yeah, so I also made a new sub domain, never done that, and found out that you can enter an email into a browser and it gets annoyed XD. ah yeah, I chnaged the color of the scroll bar, didn't know you could do that XD<br/>
                    Ok cya, this has been a fun day, oh yeah it's a 1.5* weekend :D
                    <hr/>
                <h3>23-24/11/22</h3>
                Hey, I didn't do one of these yesterday, as I went swimming, but I got prescription goggles and IT@S AMAZING!!! I can see so far, before I could see like 1 metre in each direcetion as my goggles didn't have lens in them, but now they do (fyi I've had glasses for years) It's so cool!!! I love it! So the main thing (other than goggles) I've been making a flappy bird clon and itt's mostly finished! There's one annoying thing, it doesn't seem to be loading the new version of it on FireFox, but works on Edge, so IDK what's happening! Go check it out (even though it doesn't work) grrrr Meybe when you're reading this it's been fisnished years ago, before I bought the internet... jk of course.<br/>
                    Ok byeee it's a 1.5x weekend babyyy!
                    <hr/>
                <h3>22/11/22</h3>
                Today, I got VIM which is an IDE for web development, I think it is pretty fun, but the learning curve is VERY steep so it's very difficult to start off with, though it is still pretty fun! I have continued to implement a better version of writing to the Wraithfate page, idrk what the term would be, idk what else there is to say about today...<br/>
                    Sorry these have been short recently, :(
                    <hr/>
                <h3>21/11/22</h3>
                Today I have started implementing a better version of Wraithfate where it doesn't delete everything, I have also discovered a fun game called OSRS guessr and you have to basically play GeoGuessr but with OSRS and it's so fun! I have Personal Best of Time: 59sec & Score: 20770 so I'm not that good but okay I guess. That's it for today, I haven't really done that much today, except got to go to Police Cadets and do some coding :D<br/>
                    Okay goodbye!
                    <hr/>
                <h3>19-20/11/22</h3>
                So I didn't post yesterday again, I had a lot of family over so I didn't have time, I have worked a lot on WraithFate and I added a boss to the game, in fact every boss I had planned is now in the game, they alos all have drops and they are pretty fun, I have added: Brightside, Boulevard, Neon Tiger, Kiki, Bouba, Cemetary Gates, Pompeii and FrostBite, they also all have drops: bright sword, lonely rope, neon fang, kiki spike, bouba bat, stone sythe, lava gloves and ice spike. The lava gloves auto cook fish you caught, so that's pretty fun! That's pretty much all I've done the last few days apart fromeat cakes.<br/>
                    Goodbye all.
                    <hr/>
                <h3>18/11/22</h3>
                Today I discovered a site called <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/" >Library of Babylon</a> and it's pretty cool as it contains every possible combination of characters, so you can search a thing (up to 3200 characters) and it will find it, haha, it's really cool, I found the bee movie script XD. On Wraithfate v2, I have implemented a bossing system and it actually took quite a while, so, try it out if you want, errrm I don't know what else happened today. Oh, it is actually the death anniversary of someone in my family, so that's really sad :( fo++ = 1<br/>
                    Goodbye, I didn't domuch today actually...
                    <hr/>

                    I was suposed to take a Work Experience form into the place I'm gonna go tofay, but I couldn't get one! looks like it will have to be Friday lol, so I actualy added the fighting, cooking, eating and health systems today, but I didn't remember whta I added yesterday, so I wrote that haha, My new perscription goggles arrived and I made a new Discord (and all other) profile piccture, I will update a bunch of stuff, so yeah, errrr, not much else happened toda I dont't think, oh actually, I started watching the Santa Clause new show on Disney Plus and it's pretty good, It thought some of the times seemed inconsistent and yeah, but I though it was really self aware in the way they where mocking PC a bit, but not offensively, I'm really confli - hand cramp - cted about it, so I'm really not sure haha, ok that's today.<br/>
                        Goodybe!
                        <hr/>
                <h3>15/11/22</h3>
                I've improved the whole system with displaying arrays as images and it's a lot better, it's not totaly done, but it seems well, but I'm writing this as I ask the forums how to fix my problem so yeaaah I have also added a it to chapter two, sop I hope there isn't too long left, I know that it's taking a while, but I don't think anyone really cares tbh, ermmm I didn't do much else I suppose, week days are pretty boring haha, I don't really know what to say, oh ok, I realised that I haven't been playing any video games as of late, I still play a bit, but I spend my time a lot more productively, although I still just sit oon the computer haha.<br/>
                    Ok bye, that's all for today, look out for chapter 2 soon
                    <hr/>
                <h3>14/11/22</h3>
                Ugh, I'm late today, I joined Seamus Gormans patreon today, and am binging his videos, I also finished watching Fawlty Towers too and it's really good not much else really happened today though, I had to look for fake guns and knives in Police Cadets and am still waiting for my Batman comic >:( errrr, yeah I don't know what else has happened today ahha I mena, I coontinued to make WraithFate better, but I haven't had much freetime today soooo.<br/>
                    Goddbye, I guess
                    <hr/>
                <h3>13/11/22</h3>
                I haven't done that much today, I got a Fawlty Towers series 1 and it's funny as ever haha, after that I started watching Clone Wars (again) and it's really fun, I'm currently on series 1 episode 10 Lair of Grievous. I also got a new pencil case for scholl, cause my last one was falling apart, haha, WraithFate it coming along great, still nowhere near done though, I also played a bit of GeoGuessr and have to waith between each round >:(, When I play GeoGuessr, I like to use Google, although I have to get within 10' for it to count as a success, so it's still difficult, just I'm allowed to look up locations as if Iw as dropped randomly and have a phone/laptop/internet weilding device, so yeah, Iplay it differently, but it's not like it's a multiplayer game (when I play). Other than that, I just programmed Wraithfate v2 more haha.<br/>
                    That's it for today cya.
                    <hr/>
                <h3>12/11/22</h3>
                Woah! I did a lot today!!! Firstly, I forgot to mention that I was going to Comic Con, and it was really good! I got some LOTR figures, one of a Nazgul and one of a Rider of Rohan, They where ¬£5 and ¬£6 respectively, I also got a small metal figure of Steve from Minecraft, and also a Star Trek TOS of the engineer, so it's red, I also already have a science officer blue one and they are the same type, so They are really similar except the bits that are meant to be different. I got some sweets too they are called "Taffies" and they are pretty good haha, there are so many colors or flavours XD. I saw Emporer Zurg, Davros, Daleks, Loads of Vaders and tons more, it was really good, there where also so amny posters which i would've gotten if I had the money :'( Oh yeah, I also saw a massive TARDIS which was nce, there where loads of Dr. Who figures including Rose, the Brigadeer, Mickey and more, I saw a mouse pad that was really cool as it was the map of Middle Earth and I really wanted it but it was ¬£29.95 soooo yea. Before Comic Con though I did a 5K and that was pretty good, got not much to say about that I do it every Saturday, after Comcic Con hough I have just been working of Wraithfate v2 more and made proper button textures so that's cool! I also published a video of YouTube where I show some of the features I've made so far! it's pretty awesome! Go watch it on my channel, and I think that's it...<br/>
                    Ok cya dudes!
                    <hr/>
                <h3>11/11/22</h3><img width="20" src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/symbol/92148-flower-red-remembrance-poppy-day-armistice.png" alt="Image of Poppy"/><br/>
                I've improved Wraithfate version 2 masively today, and seeing as it is the weekend now, I will hopefully improve it even more, warning though it takes far longer to program that v1 so it won't grow as quickly, but should be higher quality. Today was the eleventh of November so we had the minute silence and it was pretty cool, I didn't actually realiose it was going to happen so the bell rang (to say it was the silence) and I thought it was the end of the lesson XD so I got up before I realised it was the silence, it was sort of embarassing, but I don't think people saw haha. I returned my library book about Java Script even though it was due on the 1st of December. You can see, I added an image of a Poppy here, I think i will continue to do this on importand days as to show what day it is when quickly scrolling, and just to remind you XD. Ermm I don't actually know what to talk about haha so I guess I will leave it there.<br/>
                    Ok Goodbyeee!!!
                    <hr/>
                <h3>10/11/22</h3>
                Ok, I've done a bit today, firstly, I started on version two of Wraithfate, the original is still playable, but now I've started making one that is a lot better, firstly, it uses mostly buttons so that you don't have to ttype for everything, it's a lot cleaner. I also plan to have images and stuff in it more, but I haven't added much yet as I've been doing it for only a few hours, man coding is slooow, I'm watchng a video about making stuff in Scratch 1.4 and it's pretty cool, I also finished Derry Girls and it was pretty good I hope more episodes are coming out! I carried on watching Star Trek Next Gen and it's going good, okay, now I'm watching a video about ranking all Diary of the Wimpy kid books ooo. Ok, so the Wraithfate, yeah it's going good and now I don't know what to say sooo oh yeah I added a bunch to chapter 2 and I think it will come out in a few days or so.<br/>
                    Ok bye, I thouigh I had more to talk about XD but aparently not :(
                    <hr/>
                <h3>09/11/22</h3>
                I had three tests today!!! I had RE, it was pretty boring as it was just essays and stuff, I did sciece, which I got 20/30 in and it was just a checkup, and in Maths, I had a big exam, it was fairly important and I think I did okay, I have some extra time because we had a lockdown drill in the middle of it XD it was pretty annoying but it gave everyone the chance to exchange the answers. After school though, I noticed that Seamus Gorman had a stream planned, so I set out to watch it, I saw most of it, I started about 25 miutes in and at one poitn, I had to go eat so yeah, but the stream was really good, and I subbed to Seamus Gorman, he dyed his hair blue in this stream, it was pretty funny. While watching the stream I played RuneScape and got about 10 gold nuggets to go towards the prospector trousers in the MotherLoad Mine, but still need a lot for the full set >:( aaaanyways, as it was Wednesday, I went out swimming at half seven and I think I've improved a bit, I did eleven lengths in fifteen minutes so I though that was decent (for me anyways). uggh I don't know waht to talk about, errm , ok I will continue on chhapter two, yes I'm stil working on it and no it's not very good haha<br/>
                    Ok goodbye all

                <h3>08/11/22</h3>
                I've actually done quite a bit today, well not in the morning, then I just added a bit to theunderland.co.uk but after I got back from school I just played about with Excel and it's really fun! I made a ton of graphs! ooo they're so fun, I made like 20 ahah, I finished watching The Dark Crystal last night btw and it was really good hehe, I then started watching the prequel series again, oh oh at school I started on my GCSE coursework, we were meant to do 1-1.5 pages about how we were gonna respond to our breif but I did 4 pages haha, ok I know I'm jumping around a lot I just did quite a bit and I'm in a bog rush... ok so in Dark Crystal it's really good, i forgot about the funny Podlings XD and yeah, it's pretty creepy, wow skeksis's are wird looking, especially since they are puppets. I played around with all the office apps, because my antivirus is a bit weird it thinks the individual apps are some kind of virus maybe I'm not too sure, but they haven't worked since I got it, but office app still works, unfortunaly those ones arent as good as the normal ones as they are the same ones as the browser ones >:( so I redownloaded the office apps and messed around with them and the shortcut ect.. for a while and got them working, well all but Word, which is annoying aas it's pretty good, I still have Notepad++ though and I think that's sometimes better due to the language options for coding and stuff, although in Word, you have a really well made autocorrect system so I guess they're pretty different. I got all the other ones workig though for the most parts, I don't actually know how to use any of them except power pont and Excel so that's why I was playing on Excel graphs for ages today ahahha<br/>
                    I've actually written quite a bit today ok so bye

                Okay, I just uploaded v.2 of <a href="http://theunderland.co.uk">theunderland.co.uk</a> and now I just need to finish off all the character descriptions ect... I found out that in HTML, you can change the colour of highlighting using ::selection and it's cool! I'm watching a video about wheather Mr Bean could kill Superman and I mean it's definatly a stretch but it's really funny, caliming Mr Bean is an alien and stuuf (the animated series isn't cannon >:( grr) errrm ok what else? oh yeah, I went on patrol with Police Cadets and collected money for Poppy Day haha it was fun, collected a bit of money too, wowww!!! I just saw a super disturbing picture of Manny (diary of a wimpy kids) oh sorry, that came out of nowhere, ok so I'm watching Dark Crystal on Amazon and it's really fun, I've watched the prequel, I don't know if I've seen all of it though as my NETFLIX ACCOUNT WAS DELETED >:(((( uggghh it was so annoying!!! I got the Force Unleashed on Steam, I've already played it on PS4 Now but I've not played it on PC and it's good, better than I remember, I feel so OP haha, wow SCP-3812 is OP just heard about it in this video haha<br/>
                    Ok that's it for today goodbye!

                Hey, I saw the fireworks display today, and they started 14 minutes and 21 seconds late! seriously, I hate when people are late to these kinds of events >:( on the plus side, the display was amazing, there were all sorts of colours and shapes filling up the sky. Also, another positive is I discovered that if you do: &ltimg width="200" src="../../images/underlandReturnButton.png" onclick="history.back()"/&#60, you can make an image returnyou to the last page you were on, how awesome is that, never knew you could do that in HTML, don't know why I'm surprised though aha, I just installed an extention to FireFox which makes it look wooden and is basically like a texture pack, and I really like it, I did more work on my Underland Wiki today, and made a lot of progress ahaha! Wilson just IDED in Friday night dinner!!! WOW weird! I mean, I've already watched this part but it's still really sad am I right. errrm, right I'm gonna go carry on with my underland website ok<br/>

                <h3>05/11/22</h3>
                Well, it actually IS Bonfire Night today, we didn't see any of course, I mean, obviously the bonfires are tommorow, you know the poem, remember remember the day after the fifth of november aha. I leveled up my mining level from 61-63 and I finished the James Bond film! guess what, SPOILERS: James Bond dies, I mean, you probably know that, but still. I realised that I never expressed my views on the newest Doctor Who episode, so here it is: I thought the start was unexplained and a bit weird, the grapics in thee train scene where also pretty shit, okay and the story was alos rather shit, I mean why does The Master need this super complex and random, why is he Rasputin too! okay, so why did The Master regenerate into the Doctor if it was still his body, an evil Jodie Whitikar would've been really cool! But, all the companion cameos where really fun! At the end you even see Ian, the doctors first companion (along with Barbara and Susan) also, Ace and What's her name where cool I suppose, Graham and Ace had good chemistry. I thought it was weird that the Dalkes where there as you could just replace them with CyberMen and you wouldn't notice! I thought the scene where the Master dance to Rasputin by Boney M was funny and also cringy! This episode was VERY fan-servicey, and I loved it, the story was bad and randomly complicated but other than that I suprisingly liked it and the David Tennent at the end was so shockinbg I jumped up in my seat, well sofa, and then the teaser trailer for the next special was so epic!<br/>
                    Ok, I just got a prospector hat and goodbye

                I decided to change my filng format to dd,mm,yy rather than my old ddmmyy which is annoying. Ok so tis morning, I got locked into my house, so  was really stressed, I got 15 minutes late to school :'( aggghhh, it was so stressful!!! and on top of that... I ate a ferraro roch√© and didn't eat it perfectly, you know what I'm talking about! I went round the Library and tried to log onto the computer there, turns out you need to book it, so I just decided to do my Computer Science homework, I found a book about Java Script, there's a CD-ROM disk in the back of it and my anti virus detencted some viruses in it like whhaaat, it was an official book, it's weird, idk why haha, I'm gonna tell the library when I return it. I'm watching the inbetweeners right now and I'm on episode 6 of season one, that "cool" guy just said he'd rip out Will's throut aha<br/>

                I wasn't able to write this log yesterday, as I was going swimming and forgot to do it earlier, then I went to sleep after swimming as it was late, I am going to write this from the perspective of me yesterday so I'll still say "today" meaning tommorow. So today, I really didn't know what to play, Minecraft? GTA? RuneScape? I dn't know, I endied up just playing all of them XD, GTA seems to have a really slow response time so that's f*cking annoying! I press 'd' and turn like 50m after the place I'm supposed to turn >>>:::((( aggrgagrg, so I couldn't play much of thta, also RuneScape, oh wait before I forget to say, I am working on chapter 2 of the book, just reallly slowwly ahaha it'll release eventually, Ok ReuneScape, so I played a bit, got a load of XP then left, I have no longer got members, as it ran out, I wont refresh it until I need it haha. Minecraft, I playd a bit but again couldn't reallyt enjoy it for some reaseon :(. So I had Orthodontist today, so I only went in for half the day :D 3 periods! epic, I'm running out of time here, ermmm I went swimming at about half 8 as lanes were open then yay, I think I sort of hae the hang of this whole swimming nonsense XD<br/>

Yay, I guess, I mean the only hallowe'eney thing we did was eat sweets, and they had this "spooky" wrapping, I got GTA5 on my PC and it is really fun! The graphics are not too much for my PC surprisingly, no even any lag. I hosted a Lord of the Rings quiz and some of the questions where really hard actually, I think if I wasn't the host and actually participated, I would of gotten somewhere between 20 and 25 out of 30, so I would f done OK, but not that good for a LOTR fanatic XD, I don't know if I've ever actually mentioned that tbh lol, I love LOTR. I'm watching Lateral by Tom Scott and it's pretty fun and stuff.<br/>
                    Ok, that's iut for today, cyas

                <h3>26/10/22</h3>
                I went to Warwick, as I previously mentioned, and went on a walk/tour of the place, there was a bridge over the River Avon and you could see a view of the the castle, whoops write "the" twice XD, it was labeled as the "best view in England" which, while it was EPIC, I wouldn't totally agree with, the view from the top of the Shard was also really good, also, there is a hill in the Lake District which a=has a very good view of Windermere! The tour said to go into the horse & carrige drive way, but we couldn't as it was closed sooo... ha, instead we just went around it and skipped that part, we also saw the leycester hospital, where people live now, it was also pretty cool with timber structure and a large wooden doorway. There was a pizza express... Someone had a garden open right next to the castle, like metres away, and it was such a good view, maybe that's the best one ahaha, it was only ¬£3 aswell! I went to a charity shop and saw the extended editions to Two Towers AND Return of the King, now I've already seen both of them, but these have TONS of extended features and documentaries, there are two disks for documentarys for each film (so 4 total) and each disk contains HOURS of content! I've been watching it since 6 (10 now) and still haven't finished the first of four disks! I'm so hyped wtf!!! I'm tring to get the worldbox acheivement so will leave it on overnight :) but today I mostly played GTA on my PS4 and I shot down a freaking plane to get it's carge haha.<br/>
                    ah well I guess that;s it for today :) hope you all have a good time, goodbye!

                <h3>25/10/22</h3>
                I went swimming today, I haven't been for ages so I'm a bit rusty, I had to re-learn breathstroke haha, I think I'm getting better ;) I forgot to do this blog thing earlier so I don't have much time D: I unlocked all thye traits for the trait editor in WorldBox using Workshop worlds which can help unlock them, I gave them an upvote! I also tried to get a few acheivements and I am trying to get "Life is a sim" but it requires me to leave the game on for 24 hours :') haha, I'm actually playing right now, lots of battle and wars yeaaah, man I love the fammily tree mod. I also played a ton of Minecraft today and made a villager... erm thingy basicaly a prison where all they can do is trade with me and breed ermmm, yeah that's normal hehe. I have a villager with Mending, the best enchantment, but the first time i attempted that I accidently made it depth strider rather than Mending so now I have 2 depth strider book XD welp, that's it for now I guess, gonna play a bit of WorldBox then sleep zZZZZ...<br/>
                    Byeeee!!!
                    <hr/>
                <h3>24/10/22</h3>
                I played a ton of WorldBox today, I got a new mod called FamilyTreeMod and it's soooo good!!! You can see an entire family tree, so if you start with just one character, everyone else descends from that one person (World Box people reproduce Asuxually.) I also Played Minecraft, I made a new wordl with the seed "DeaDvey" and there is a mountain right next my house, I built a watch tower right on top of it XD, right now I'm dual weilding Notepad++ (text editor for my blog) and finding Chickens in Minecraft haha, also btw I will give my review of Doctor Who newest episode next Sunday, so everyone can watch it. I also played Trackmania, but didn't manage to beat my record on A0-7 so :( I did however manage to connect my PS4 controller up to Trackmania nd play with that so yay, I watched a YouTube video about the full history of Halloween (film franchise not paegan festival) even though I've never seen any of them. I can feel my index finger skin peeling off as I write this haha, I think that's an exadgeration but it does hurt so who knows hehe owwwwww. I am finally continuing to watch Star Trek Next Gen and am on S1E22, so I was watching Star TRek through ages ago but stopped and am now continueing, I didn't watch 22 episodes in a day (I wish) Rishi Sunak was made PM today, I think he'll be better than Liz Truss (our now shortest ruling PM) but still Tory so bleh, also fun fact now is the first timne since 1952 that we haven't been ruled by an Elizebeth as Liz is short for Elizebeth and we used to have Queen Elizebeth (RIP) wow, I've used a lot of Brackets today haha.<br/>
                    Thta's it for todayz haha, Live long and Prosper

                New Doctor Who episode aired today but before I get to that, I spent practcally all day playing Trackmania and I got a 27:46 on A0-7 and I'm now 440th on the leaderboard I think aha, I didn't play any Minecraft but now have like 25 hours on Trackmania, I've been watching a lot of Wirtual. So I set an alarm for 7:20pm so I could watch Doctor Who and I remembered anyways, I tried to get it on the telly but I had a weak or no signal, played around a bit and couldn't fix it! I figured out I could watch it on BBC Iplayer so that's all dandy, I was sooo good, I don't want to spoil it thopugh so watch it here: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">Iplayer</a> After I watched Dr. Who I realised my alarm had been going off for an hour and a half XD, not much else actually happened today so ya, Doctor Who goood, Trackmania goood, err, oh yeah Youtube isn't working on FireFox so I had to watch on Edge, so FireFox baaad.<br/>
                    Goodbye all have a good time!

                <h3>22/10/22</h3>
                Today I went to Worcester but first I went on a run, 5k (3m) and I got a decent time, I think it's my 72nd time going to Parkrun, I'm exited for the 100 shirt, but that'll be a while still on the way to and fro the park I listened to the Undertale soundtrack on CD. After this I played a bit of Trackmania and then went to town on the bus, I took the train to Worcester and when we got there, someone put something in the bin and the bin said "Cheers mate!" and I was like whaaata, the bin speaks lmao, I got some chips and panini at a caf√© called Poppins and also had a cherry pancake and it was pretty nice, I then went to the comic books hopp, but before I got there I saw a CEX and went in, I got a solitare game for my DSL and it plays pretty well, I then went in the comic shop, I saw some Doctor who Big Finish Production CDs, but unfortunatly they were rather pricey so I didn't get any, on top of this, I saw The Dalek World, which I recognised as I have a poster of it in my room, it was ¬£75, I didn't get it. I then looked up where WaterStones is and was shocked to find that it was just over the road XD I am so blind, I went in and as they where rearanging, the genres wher mixed up, books about stalin in cooking haha, anyways I found an awesome book about tolkein and it's basically a super in depth encyclopeadia about Tolkeins Legendarium , it was ¬£25 and I got it, It. Is. AWESEOMNEMEME!!! Then I went to the Commandery which is a Civil war museum, I could really rant about that but I don't have much ime so: They had a typewriter, a cool medieval painted roof, a super old foundation, a cannon, a parlimentarain dress up thing and a super old rug. I went back to the train station whilst picking up a Sooubway and binned something to hear the talking bins it said "Thanks!". On the return journey, I played solitare and then went home, I played a few hours of trackmania and got an author medal so yeayyy!<br/>
                    That abou brings you up to date Cheers Mates!
                <hr/>
                <h3>21/10/22</h3>
                Yeeee! It's half term now! getting closer to Hallowe'en! I'm exited, I hear Hallowe'en is a lot bigger in the US but idk, we get about 10 trick or treaters on Hallowe'en night! Ok, I'm gonna research it now, I'm watching a YouTube video about it, I'll finish it off when I've finished the video. Ok while I'm watching; I am making a maze in Minecraft and i've almost finished the layout, I still have to mkae it 3-4 blocks high (Haven't decided) After school, my friend had to do some French thing for 5 and I waited, we walked back together, I split off to go to the library and refreshed my library card so I can take out books in the future, while writing this I can hear a zombie dying and it's kinda disracting XD. Ok anyway after I got home I looked for some revision cards for a science test after half term so yayyay (not) There were'nt any so I went ot (in the rain) to get some, I found some in WHSmiths for ¬£4! so I got those, but I didn't actually know if I had that much haha so I had to go home to check, then back out once I knew I did, but I checked other shops like ASDA, Wilko's, The Works and Poundland. Ok so apparently USA just goes bigger out on all holidays so liek CHristmas and probably Easter too, that makes sense, they do be a bit crazy (disclaimer, Americans are not crazy (disclaimer, I think)) It's been raining all day ughh, at least it's cozier inside when it's wet haha.<br/>
                    That's it for today I think g'day mate
                    <hr/>
                <h3>20/10/22</h3>
                I had the same breakfast as yesterday :D and it was nice as ever lmao. There was a fire alarm at school and it was raining so we had to stand out in the cold rain haha, I wasn't actually that bad, although I didn't have a coat, it wasn't too wet, I arrived at school just as the whistle blew so that was lucky, I always leave home at just the right time, and today it was perfect!!! It's been a while, we didn't have assembly so that was good, I hate those, just end up talking about knife crime and stuff, which is important, but like pretty boring too, we always do that, I swear! I played D&D and we almost got to the big boss, but we were fighting the Trogolodytes, there were 10! that took most of the session XD after school I went to the local library and finished Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane and so I was finishing that off, I guess it's onto Curse of the Warmbloods now, the ending to Prophecy of Bane was good as ever, but I though he told Mrs Cormaci about the underland at the end of that one, but it must be at the end of Curse of the warmbloods, that'd make sense I guess, I'm planning on making a labyrinth or maze type thing in Minecraft, and actually whilst I'm saying this it sounds like it's influenced by the labyrinth in TUC but it's actually not haha! I just realised this lol, I ate chips with a copious amount of salt and vinegar, sooo nice also curry sauce, that was delice, how do you spell it, lemmie look that up. Ohg (just saw this mispell) it's spelt "Delish" that makes sense" ok I think that it for today haha<br/>
                    Goodbye all! see you tommorow! (I tried to do ctrl+1 there)
                <hr/>
                <h3>19/10/22</h3>
                In the morining I ate: nutela toast, apple slices and some apple juice (Apple reigns supreme >:). At school I, no the whole class got Rickrolled by the teacher and it was hilarious, I think those first six notes strike the most fear into any sane person. duh duh duh duh dun dun duuuu oh wait no that's seven lmao. Some people in science had a big argument around me and I just sat there haha it was kind of scary... I didn't play much Minecraft today, I got a new game which I don't totaly understand called "World History Sim" I also played a game that I saw on Drew Durnil called "Ages of Conflict" and that one is really fun, you basically add loads of kingdoms to a world and they grow and fight to take over the world and it's really fun haha. I might play it now but I'm about to go to sleep, I updated the TUC fan-site a bit but haven't put it public yet, it's getting close though. "Ages of Conflict" is similar to WorldBox but more modern and you can't see the individual troops just an overview. I also made a Minecraft server but it's not that good hehe.<br/> 
                    Ok that's it today cya people!
                <hr/>
                <h3>18/10/22</h3>
                I didn't do much today, nothing is coming to mind, Just watched YouTube and Blackadder, welp, this is depressing. I finished a cool tower in Minecraft and carried on using LOD so it looks pretty good. saves a lot of resources<br/>
                    Wow, I have nothing more to say, cya!
                <hr/>
                <h3>17/10/22</h3>
                Because it is Intensitive week now I didn't go to my regular Police Cadets and that meant I had more time to do my French Homework and watch Blackadder, I also watched a youtube series where someone reacted to MapMen videos, which I love, and that means I can watch all the MapMen episodes every day. HAHA I forgot how funny Percy was lmao, I'm on Blackadder ii btw, although it was my least favourite one of the four, I still really like it! Stephen Fry is also really funny, I think I first saw him on QI, and now it's Sandy so yeah, that's sad :( On top of all that, I got a Minecraft mod that takes advantage of LOD and that means you can load far more chunks, still with the same performance, thay do this by not showing the full texture of things further away, meaning your game isn't loading every single individal pixel on every texture, which is very memory intensive, actually most games do this which is why you can see much further without lagging in games like GTA or Breath of the Wild, I'm surprised Minecraft doesn't do this alreaddy, it would be a great improvement to the base game, I think. btw, I highly recommend, when binging TV shows, which is most of what I do, watch it on 1.5x speed, so you can watch a 20 minute episode in 15 minutes. That's it for today peeps (never said peeps before XD) goodbye!

                <h3>16/10/22</h3>
                i started having to use FireFox, in advance of Manifest v.3 and it's quite nice, looks very different to Oprah, cause Oprah uses the same API as Chrome I think. Anyways I started re-watching Blackadder, and the Theme Song rocks as ever, Blaaackaddder blaccckk addder, he ridddes a pittch black hoooorse! Yeah it's really good! I dug out an entire chunk in Minecraft and started making a lake-side house. I made a new Regalia in Minecraft called Regalia v.2 and I have tons of additional ores now for more immersion, idk if I mentioned it actually, also I removed Xaero's map and used JourneyMap instead as I prefer it, you can look at it in a browser.<br/>
                    I think that's it for today haha cya

                <h3>14/10/22-15/10/22</h3>
                Ooooh, this is quite overdue! I was very busy, but you may be pleased to know that I got the commenting system working late last night and it's super cool! It works across computers, I hope it doesn't get bot spammed though :( Ok, I just found an unlisted London Unfinished episode, it's really cool! THIS IS LIFECHANGING!!!! Anyways, I made a Minecraft world called Regalia and it's basically where I live in a cave and have to be self sufficient and not go up to he surface like the Underlanders, I haveto kill spiders for beds >:( I also have a mod that adds ores and things to the game for more underground imersion haha!, and ways I think that's mostly it for the last two days, it's sort of hard to remember haha!

                <h3>13/10/22</h3>
                I haven't played Fortnite Save the World in ages, I'm going to help someone on my server do pre quests for MSK, so Im pretty pumped, It's Fortnitemares and I'm going to save up for Gravedigger as people say it's pretty good, although I already have the Mythic weapons so yeeeahhh idk, wow the Mythics are so OP! accept the hammer lmao. Ok so I wrote that last bit before the game and now it's half hour later, so I kept freezing >:( and then I lagged out, I forgot that used to always happen haha, but I got to play with my mythic toys again, and save some survivours of course. I bought the Undertale Soundtrack as I wanted a download copy haha, idk why but, even though I have them on Spotify, it's so much nicer having the digital copies lol. As you know, I played some Fortnite which was nice as well as some Minecraft and, no WoW surprisingly (Yes I've started abreviating it) I made a favourites folder too. I finished reading TUC Gregor The Overlander and moved onto The Phrophecy of Bane and it's good! My favourite is Code of Claw for sure though! Well it's getting late I have to go goodbye folks!

                <h3>12/10/22</h3>
                Well... Alot more happened today than yesterday, you'll be pleased to know haha. Firstly, I was just chilling playing Minecraft when, disaster! I noticed it was half past eight and I had to leave now, I rushed up to get changed and had no time to brush my teeth so just rushed out the door, luckily I wasn't late so that was good, but phoor I was scared. I only actually went in for two periods as I had a doctors appointment, so at break time I just signed out and left, it was so fun haha, I was playing Minecraft whilst everyone else was doing Maths lmao. Aaaanyway after the appointment I carried on playing Minecraft and started a new building, I also played some World of Warcrfat but only for a few minutes so yeah, I redownloaded Battlefront ii EA and it still didn't work, It's so annoying :( I still don't know what the problem is >:(. Wow! I felt like a lot more happened today but I can't think what to write aha, Right now I'm watching a documentry about Netflix and it's pretty interesting, there're story is full of ups and downs, Wow Blockbuster really flopped huh, I remember it, and it's still a phrase to say "Blockbuster film" so lol. Ok That's it for today, I gotta go now cya!

                <h3>11/10/22</h3>
                Well practiaclly nothing happened today, how where you, haha. I made pancakes they where pretty nice I had two, with lemon and sugar and also I... cut the lemon, yeah interenting. I played Minecraft and finished my tree farm it's pretty great, took ages to make haha. I got a few new mods on my new installation, AppleSkin, Fullbright and Just Enough Items, haha they're pretty great, FullBright is greeaaat! I did my homework, OMG today was so boring nothing happened, I think I'm gonna start writing chapter two of my thing so yeah cya.
                <hr/>
                <h3>10/10/22</h3>
                Today Was quite stressfull XD I couldn't do my homework so I did it after school and hope my teacher doesn't care. We did a bleep test and we had to get to level 5.2, I was the only one who got to it haha I was surprised especially as I was wearing a backpack that was kind of heavy, I was proud with myself, I think once I got to level 13.3 so I wasn't too worried, although that was using a different sized field and different bleep system, you could just walk on the first couple XD. Anyways I didn't play any World of Warcraft today but I did play Minecraft actually right now, it's really lagging though so am kind of afk hehe, I published my story at <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14146567/1/Gregor-and-The-Prophecy-of-Sand">The-Prophecy-of-Sand</a> and no one has actually read it yet, though I did put it on the Underland Subreddit haha getting it out there, It's not that good but it is my first one and I'm not that good at writing haha I did a lot of homework tonight so I didn't really play much video games 'cept maybe an hour of Minecraft and Plauge Inc (combined) so yeah, less than usual, Plauge inc is doing good, I unlocked Virus as well as a few genes to use to help with the game, I really want this one gene that decreases chances of mutation as that's actually pretty useful for my stratagy haha, I think I'm gonna go now though there's not much else that happened today<br/> cya!
                <hr/>
                <h3>09/10/22</h3>
                Ooooh cool writing this in UTF-8 aparently, hehe, I finished Rick and Morty, how tf did it only take three days??? (binge watcher am I right???) Anywayyy I started continueing watching To-Ra-Do-Ra and I'm on episode 16 not much to say about it right now though it looks pretty good, I havn't really continued writing the fan-fic, maybe I'll do that right after this haha. Oh I started playing Minecraft after a looong Hietus, Playing CubedMC and a lot has changed maybe I'll carry on making Youtube videos on it :) taht'll be fun I suppose. Also just FYI I removed the Games and Anime pages on this site about a week ago, the pages still exist you just can't link there, they're kind of pointless as I can just put all that on this page. I got Plauge Inc. and killed the ENTIRE world, it's really fun, you're basically a disease and you start with one infection and you have to kill the world, the tactic is to just spread to everyone without them noticing then eveovle stuff like totla organ failiure and shit haha everyone suddenly just dies in like a week (in game time) it's really fun! Ok I'm gonna carry on playing Minecraft nowww byywywwy
                <hr/>
                <h3>08/10/22</h3>
                Well today has not been the best, firstly I went on a run which was ok then I played World of Warcraft a bit, turns out there's a WoW film! It doesn't seem that good, I'm on the episode of Rick and Morty where there's just a random-ass dragon. Ok the bad bit, My Steam stopped working :(((( I can't play any games, I think I have to reset my pc >:((( I have tried everything but cannot figure it out, I tried re-installing it and everything, I'm sad, I have already backed up my PC so I can reset it at any time, I'm just looking for help now. So I was running this cool ant simulator and they referenced it in a different ant simulator youtube video, what's the chances?!?! actually pretty high, the ant evolution simulator isn't a giant fandom so yeaeeeah I guesss. Well I guess that's it for today really byeee.
                <hr/>
                <h3>07/10/22</h3>
                So I started watching Rick and Morty and it's pretty funny, I think Jerry is my favourite character, I just got to season two episode 3 and they're just bording this random ship haha ok now Jerry is looking for a weed wacker wtf. I also started playing Elder Scrolls Online and it's pretty fun from what I've played so far, and the map is massive, I played a bit of World of Warcraft too and got to level 29, finally!<br/>
                    Also I watched this show called A - something idrk, it was ok but a bit weird. I got this new water bottle and it has a filter thing in it, so I put a lemon on it ;)<br/>
                    I guess that's it for today not much really happened today so that's it for now cya!
                <hr/>
                <h3>06/10/22</h3>
                Sorry I forgot to update it yesterday so I'm updating this the next day, I played a lot of World of Warcraft and did some questing :) I also watched some and that's why I couldn't update it yesterday, I had some cereal so thats yum, and crunchy corner. see here's the problem with updating it the next day: I can't really remember much of what happened so this is where I leave it for today sorry!
                <hr/>
                <h3>05/10/22</h3>
                Well today I didn't play any World of Warcraft, woah weird right? well anyway I started writing that fanfiction I said about and I quite like how it's going at the moment I'm doing chapter one at the moment and am on Paragraph 4 (ish) so it's going well, I started re-watching The Office (UK) and It's so funny haha. I did a quiz about Lord of the Rings and got them all right lmao. Right now I'm listening to Cemetary Gates by The Smiths and ooooh it goood I also started a new save on Cookie clicker I already have 34 million cookies, ayyyy I'm enslaving loads of Grandmas, I have a cookies per second rate of 30K so that's nice. I won a game of Backgammon yeaaaah and I started adding a Boss feature to Wraithfate, the first one is called Brightside as in the Killers song, they're all named after songs haha (gonna get copyrighted ;))<br/>
                    Well that's it for now goodbye all :)
                <hr/>
                <h3>04/10/22</h3>
                Hey, I started using Notepad++ rather than Notepad to write my Blogs and this is the first time using it for this purpose, I've used it for programing server side on my other website inside Filezilla so it's useful for that, I'll let you know how it goes, it's a bit like Notepadbut it is better, it supports stuuf like coding and it's just a lot better in general, for instance I don't have to hit enter every time I want to go onto a new line, the formating is just tons easier and it has way more feautures lmao<br/>
                    I finished rewatching How I Met Your Mother (for the third time) and now I'm watching a clip of every bit on HIMYM content that took place in the future! It's so nostalgic for some reason haha! apparently the latest bit of content is in 2038 even though Ted's telling the story in 2030 lmfa. The ending to HIMYM is so good, I wont spoil it but How Your Mother Met Me is sooooooo gooood!!!!<br/>
                    I didn't play much World of Warcraft but I did get that tabard, it's white with green bits on it. I think I might release some fanfictions on my <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15593995/">Fanfiction.net</a> account so keep tuned for that, although tbh I might not am not very organised!<br/>
                    I think that's it for now, goodnight everyone time for noodles
                <hr/>
                <h3>03/10/22</h3>
                Last night before I slept I started re-reading The Underland Chronicles and it's so good you should
                read it. It's about a boy called Gregor who falls to this place under Manhattan called 'The
                Underland' and he has to complete these Prophocies to help the people of the Underland
                (Underlanders) and fight against giant rats (Gnawers) with the giant bats (flyers) and giant
                cockroaches (crawlers), the ending is a big cliff hanger so there is actually a lot of fan-fiction
                even though the book isn't super popular, it's also written by the same authour as The Hunger Games
                but was written first, I think I'm on every single public Discord server based on the books lmao.
                <br/>
                I got to level 28 with Druid and I got Entangling Roots rank three and Rejuvenation rank five, I
                also did The Stockade with some people from my Guild and a friend, I completed some Stockade quests
                and got a ton of exp, I also was fully accepted into Dusk (Guild) and got 5G and a tabard which is
                pretty cool.
                <br/>
                I think that's really all for today, it's getting a bit late though so cya! Sorry it was a bit short
                today :(

                <hr/>
                <h3>02/10/22</h3>
                Today I played more World of Warcraft on both my main and new alt account, on my alt I didn't level up
                at all but I did train my dagger skills some more and as I was so low I got a lot of levels as I was
                fightng reletivley high enemies, so I got like a level per hit, my chat box was mad haha!<br/>
                On my alt I reached level seven and did a few quests, I got summon food as an ability, wow mages are 
                so cool, I think I prefer it to druid beacuse we can summon stuff, remember the log from 29/09/22? I 
                refered to my top three super powers, creation was third and shapeshifting was first, but seeing as
                the druids shapeshifting power isn't super diverse I think I might prefer the mage to druid, but I
                will also try out preist, I've made a priest on WoW retail so I sorta know what it's like<br/>
                I started rewatching Ghosts from the start and also watched a bit more of How I Met Your Mother and
                I'm now on season nine, I always forget how great the Mother reveal in season eight is.<br/>
                Anyways goodbye, am going to eat unhealthy cereal and use my new brace brushes to clean my braces cya!
                <hr/>
                <h3>01/10/22</h3>
                Well I got level 27 in World of Warcraft and I started playing this game on 
                Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468260/Leaf_Blower_Revolution__Idle_Game/">Leaf Blower Revolution</a>
                And it's pretty fun, it's and idle game and I'm literally playing as I... type?
                Yeha, so it's pretty fun, you basically collect leaves and unlock new leaves and
                speeds and other upgrades and It's kinda addictive ^v^ lmao. In WoW I did a lot
                of questing, I didn't do any dungeons like usual, But I added this one guy and
                we killed lots of skellies and ghouls, got a lot of xp haha, I unlocked starfire
                rank two I also worked out that my best attack is moonfire (dmg/mana) but it 
                doesn't stack so that's a bummer :( I also started a new character who is a 
                human mage and I got a few levels, I helped a guy download Questie, I felt 
                incredibly proud! I watched episodes 1-2 of ghosts season four on Iplayer and
                it's looking great so far the second one was quite funny. I made a confidential
                folder just for fun and I'ts legen - wait for it - dary, I added the killer joke
                from Monty Python to it so no-one can find it ;) It's hilarious I almost died,
                oh I just though about it again, oh hahah anbiiuo omggg!!! foiagbiayygiiubioung
                gguhggg<br/>
                sorry this log wasn't as long as usual, also who loved the ending am I right anyway it's late cya

                ‚Ä¢2.2567676767<br/>
                Those are my calculations for my HP/Mana for different heal spells in World of Warcraft, I did a pretty
                tense dungeon, took just over two hours with this pretty awesome group of guys. It was Blackfathom Deeps
                (I was doing it for the Staff)and it was legen - wait for it - dary. The first boss was Ghamoo-ra, that 
                turtle was pretty easy, but had high armour, I healed the tank, the next was Lady Sarevess, the way in was 
                hard, tons of mermaids and stuff but once we got to the Lady it was smooth sailing. After that we took on 
                Argent Guard Thaelrid, but the teamhad taken him down before I got there, I'm guessing he was pretty easy so
                That wasn't a big deal but I did turn in a quest by right clicking his corpe so thats a positive haha! We 
                then rounded the corner, came back and fought Gelihast, the room was full of fishmen so it was a bit before 
                we got to it, I healed yadayada we beat it ect... We walked to the next room and. Got. Wrecked. We 
                accidently pulled half the room and it was a disaster, the whole party died when we got back we where a bit 
                more careful XD and we beat it, not without a few more dying along the way but we where revived so that was
                fine, after taking down Old Serra'kis, who was surpriisingly easy lmao we went on to the star of the show,
                Twilight Lord Kelris, now for context a few days previously I tried to do this dungeon with just one other
                guy to try get this staff and we where destroyed, we had to quit, so this was important, the boss was fairly
                easy but the important bit was the Dice Roll, I was on the edge of my seat and you know what! I won, I rolled
                a 65 and I beat the Preist who was also rolling need so I was cheerful, contented, delighted, man these 
                synonyms from <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com">Thesaurus . com</a> are not right, I was super happy ok got
                it. We then went to Aku'mai's lair and it looked like a freaking great Dragon fight it was EPIC! The tank 
                rushed forward and I saved his life multiple times, the boss did a lot of damage! but we beat it and it was
                cool, then we ported back to Darnassus and I turned in some quests. Other than that nothing particually 
                awesome happened in my REAL life lmao, but it is the weekend so that is pretty cool I love the weekend I
                might play some D&D idk. Well that's it for today I suppose.<br/>
                goodbye for now and goodnight!
                <hr/>
                <h3>29/09/22</h3>
                Woohoo, I got level 25 in WoW, half way (level speaking) to 50! Next I just need level 30 and I will get
                the travel form, also did I mention that I unlocked the aquatic form not too long ago, but I'm really
                exited for the land travel form as It's more useful, I mean, their isn't land everywhere! But also the
                Dire Bear form sounds pretty cool, also the Travel Form is pretty useful as it's like a mount but you can
                unlock it at level 30 rather than 40! Well a mount is better but it's still pretty cool, this is why I
                love th Druid class, also just shapeshifting in general is the best, it's in my top three superpowers
                I would have if I could have any powers!<br/>
                ‚Ä¢Shapeshifting<br/>
                ‚Ä¢Telepathy<br/>
                ‚Ä¢Creation<br/>
                If I had shapeshifting and could become any creature, I would totally become a Pereguin Falcon as they
                are super quick, also fleas as they're super strong and high stamina and they are really small so you
                could sneak about and knick stuff. Not that I'd rob (I'd totally take the Crown Jewels, not to get the 
                money just to prank the Queen, I mean King now I guess, woah we have a King... weird. yeah so I'd knick 
                it and then give it back and they'd be like woaaaah) haha. welp anyway I'm getting distacted, but I was
                thinking the other day that if you have Telepathy you can kind of create anything like with Creation, I
                mean you'd have to know the chemical formula and it's formation, and the elemnts would have to be in the
                eniroment, so it would be a bit worse but still kind of a cheat sheet am I right? So if I had Creation,
                I'd create like a massive sword just before fighting a dragon and it would be so cool, cause I could 
                sharpen it with the Telepathy so it's super OP. Well I got to go now so cya folks have a good one! 
                Also this blog is a lot longer than the last I'm trying to lenghten them ;)

                I'm writing this on the next morning as I was out until late, I went out to the Theatre to see South 
                Pacific and it was pretty good. It was about an American nurse and a French murderer falling in love on
                an Island in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific_(musical)" >South Pacific</a>, the French guy almost dies at one point. I also did more questing in
                World of Warcraft, and I can't remember much else that happened
                <hr/>
                <h3>27/09/22</h3>
                Not much happened today, I made a nice music peice that has a pretty dramatic tune and I think the teacher liked
                it, said it sounded like a Star Wars track, wonder where I got that from :} Pretty cool for just a two bar loop 
                and a few measly instuments on the board lmao. I got level twenty-four in World of Warcraft (WoW) and I unlocked 
                the next rank in thorns as well as a dispel enchantment and a couple others, I also did the Stockade dungeon and
                attempted the Blackfathom Deep dungeon, someone was carring me, and completly flopped it XD I was trying to get the
                good staff as a drop from one of the bosses but didn't manage to get there :(. I started rewatching the Lord of the
                Rings the Fellowship of the Ring and I forgot how amazing the soundtrack was!
                Gonna go listen to How I Met Your Music and Spotify so cya later!
                <hr/>
                <h3>26/09/22</h3>
                Whoops!!! So on Friday I left my PE kit in form so today I was going to pick it up from form, all good right so I 
                picked it up in AM form and it was all going well until; disaster struck, like a bolt of ferocious lightning, as I 
                was walking to Music I realised I didn't have it! but I had it during second Science so It was either in second 
                Science or Computer science, after form I went to Computer Science (oh I forgot to mention, I had a club after 
                school I always attend, okay you're back up to speed) I walked past said club on the way to Computer Science, and it
                wasn't there, so I went to Science, and it was there, but by this point I was walking <u>away</u> from said club and I
                just carried walking, I forgot to go to the club!!! Well that's a story phew. At least I got the PE kit. I did some
                more dungeoning on World of Warcraft (Deadmines and Stockade) didn't level up anymore sadly, but I got about 1 [and
                maybe a half]? gold peices, so that's good. A new season of Ghosts dropped on Iplayer so am going to be watching that
                for sure! I joined a new guild on World of Warcraft, called Dusk, it's pretty neat.
                Now, time for crackers and milk I suppose, goodnight!
                <hr/>
                <h3>25/09/22</h3>
                I got to season three in How I Met Your Mother and I saw the bit where ted gets a butterfly tatto I always am
                surprised at how important it was, I also did some dungeoning with some people I met in The Dagger Hills North of 
                Moonbrook, it was the Deadmines and I got 2 gold peices from it so that was rather profitable from just one run. I
                also got to level 23 on my main druid account so I'm one level closer to the fabled level 40, am exited to get the 
                mount skill and get a mount, god traveling will be so fast! I was AFKing in Melvor Idle (Great game you should totaly
                get it) it's basically a text based RuneScape and I got to level 88 in woodcutting, the xp curve is really steep, even
                steeper than in RuneScape, if I reach level 90 I can cut a new type of tree, idk what tree it is though. I finished
                watching Lord of the Rings the Return of the King and it was greater than I remembered, my sister cried at the ending
                which was funny and is now sending me random Lord of the Rings memes lmao, but the Fruit Pastels was delish.
                Guess this is it for tonight, will play a bit more World of Warcraft before I go to sleep and eat Pot Noodles.
                ;) goodnight...
                
                Afterthought: Just watched a scene where Ted was playing World of Warcraft lmao.
                <hr/>
                <h3>24/09/22</h3>
                Well, it's been one hell of a day! didn't have to go running firstly as I lost my trainers so that's a plus :) (love 
                not exercising ;)) I did my Maths and French homework and watched three hours of Lod of the Rings The Return of the 
                King (extended edition) and that was pretty nice, my god the Oliphant scene (Chef's kiss) oh and I got to level 22
                in World of Warcraft classic and that's pretty great I leveled up my wrath ability, moved a sofa around and it looks
                so different now, it's trippy `o` woah.
                Well anyways I'll leave it here tonight it's 22:20 here so I'll be going to sleep now goodbye ;)
                <hr/>
                <h3>25/07/22-23/09/22</h3>
                phewwwweeeee!!! been two months, I guess I've been busy, well didn't really do much during the six month holiday 
                but near the end of it I went to Brighton to visit family and we went up the British Airways i360, the view was 
                stunning I could see the wind farms out in the channel and there was a really cool ranbow car outside a small 
                park, I visited a Waterstones and didn't get anything haha, then I went to CEX (Entertainment Exchange) and got 
                Nintendogs nad I made a dog called 'Dave' and I sometimes take him (her?) on walks round the virtual neighborhood 
                :D. Then I went sailing which was ùî•ùî¨ùîØùîØùî¶ùîüùî©ùî¢ (<\-- that says 'horrible' but the UTF-8 cannot read it, but I'm keeping it
                anyway as it looks cool in the editor) I ended up just going home as I felt sick from seasickness and couldn't
                sleep so I was exhausted, eh. Then on the 7th of September something truly dreadful happened. School started back 
                up D: I know right! dreadful. nah it's fine really, the maths is just challenging enough to still be fun and 
                computer science is also really fun! Iah woah! a popup just appeared on my screen lol as I was saying, I have 
                vowed to update this page daily! like I used to, now lets see how long it takes to break it! Oh and I rewatched 
                all of How I Met Your Mother again and it was so good! I'm just gonna say this, and I know it's controversal but,
                the ending is actually growing on me! (Also I'm writing this in notepad so It's a slightly different format)
                I'm going to go watch Lord Of the Rings so cya I guess this is it 
                <hr/>
                <h3>23/06/22-24/07/22</h3>
                So, errr, I decided to update this page monthly (roughly) and a lot has gone down in the past month that I'm sure you're not interested in...
                <br/>firstly! I started following the Batman and the Detective Comics line of DC comics from <a href="https://forbiddenplanet.com">Forbidden Planet</a> But their service is down
                <br/>right now as their updating the payment methods or whatnot, so if you're are visiting this in real time, it wont work, but their services are good, on the subject of comics...
                <br/>I looked on <a href="https://www.comicshoplocator.com">The COmic shop locator</a> and found out theres a comic shop just one mile away... but turns out that was just a office
                <br/>, and the true shop was just on the internet, so that's annoying >:(, they are quite new too! 
                <br/>On another subject, I had my Birthday recently, and got a DS Lite which is fun, I played MarioKart a lot and also this cool crossword game too! The DSL is really fun and I even 
                <br/> played with my friend a bit, which was neat, I got really good at RainBow road as I did the time trial lots! lolz, I started a Minecraft world with my firend and we got the Ender
                <br/>Dragon the other day soooo... take that I also got <b>6 Months</b> of RuneScape membershi, so I'm set!
                <br/>I bought the original Call Of Duty, Mini Motorways and Melvor Idle with my Steam gift card. I ordered Pokemon Saphire off of EBay and it will arive on Wednesday, so I'm exited 
                <br/>for that! and I'm also awaiting the next issue of Batman and Detective Comics, both of which release on Wednesday too!
                <br/>That's it for me, I'm signing off, cya, wouldn't wanna be ya!
                <hr/>
                <h3>15-22/06/22</h3>
                ummmmmmm, so my PC boke, that's why I haven't been posting for agggggges! I had to have my entire hardrive which is annoying, but some stuff is on the
                <br/>OneDrive so it's not allll bad, I have to redownload all my games which is a pain, aparently my Windows was corrupted sooooo haha, I can continue working
                <br/>on WraithFate now that my PC is back so I am planning on adding a save game feature :D.
                <hr/>
                <h3>12-14/06/22</h3>
                Over the weekend, literally did NOTHING! On Monday I went to Manga club and we made bookmarks and watched Manga, which was fun
                <br/>(It was Saki. K) yay, gonna continue working on WraithFate :)
                <hr/>
                <h3>06-11/06/22</h3>
                whoooooooo! I keep putting this post on hold, as I'm learning JavaScript (and grinding RuneScape) so I havn't had much
                <br/>time basically, I'm making a text-based-RuneScape-like game in js, when it's done I will add it to the menu on
                <br/><a href="index.html">the home page</a> I havn't made loads of prgress, maybe expect it sometime in the next month
                <br/>(If I actually finish it hahaha), so I've decided I might do this sort of longer but less frequent kind of post
                <br/>It's just more enjoyable to write, as often my days are pretty boring lmao, I got membership in RuneScape, as someone
                <br/>gave me a bond which was very nice of them, if you're reading this, thank you! I am grinding magic skill with sand
                <br/>crabs and am already level 50, nice.
                <br/>I also took apart my old <a href="#mouse">mouse</a> (the one that wasn't working) and it looks cool, I'll post a new
                <br/>photo on the <a href="photos.html">Photos page</a> for you to see, the crazy thing is, it still works
                <hr/>
                <h3>02-05/06/22</h3>
                OK! so the reason I havn't been on in AGGGGGGEEEEESSSS is because I went to Londoon! Then I went to holiday in the Lake District! it was fun!
                <br/>So firstly, in London I did the Doctor Who Immersive expeirience which was soooo fun! I would suggest it, I also got a few Batman comics and
                <br/>issue 2 of My Hero Acedemia
                <br/>In the lake district I did some walks and ate some chips at a pub haha we walked up to this cool tower at one point which was nice, it was built
                <br/>in the 18th century and so it wasn't that big, but good for that day and age lmao, we had alot of fires in the house and I tended to the flame
                <br/>which was nice and heated the cottage, thats it for this... collection of days? ummmm
                <br/>cya I guess?
                <hr/>

                Today I went to Polic cadets and we ate pizza, also the Royal British Navy popped in and tried to recruit us lmao.
                <br/>Apparently it's good pay and they pay for your university funds which is cool, still not joining xd.
                <br/>We got to make some flares out of paper and launch them to the sky, ours was sh*t lol, someones went like 30 metres!
                <br/> it was amazing! I also began using RuneLite rather than normal RuneScape client, it's so much better with all the extra
                <br/>plugins
