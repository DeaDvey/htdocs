            <h1 class="blog-title">RSS feeds and Star Wars Squadrons</h1>
            <p class="blog-content">Hey people (person(me)), I just updated my website to have an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS'>RSS Feed</a> so that I can read them in Fluent Reader or Nextcloud News, the two RSS readers I use mostly, I cannot get them all to show up in Nextcloud News however, only the most recent one, maybe an issue with the formating? Ah well, I'll try troubleshoot that I guess.  Secondly, I recently got the game <a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222730/STAR_WARS_Squadrons/'>Star Wars Squadrons</a> on my PC after already having played it on my PS4 and I was surprised at the poor reviews, I always found the game really fun and the integrated HUD really fun to use, guess I just am different lol, anyway<br/> Fly You High - DeaDvey<br/><img src='https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1222730/header.jpg?t=1662047498' /></p>

            <h1 class="blog-title">Late December Update Before Christmas</h1>
            <p class="blog-content">Hey guys, so I have been trying out Nextcloud since I did the last blog and I really like it, it's very good, the calendar especially, I think I definately prefer it to Proton Drive and Calendar because it's way better intergreated in to apps and stuff, there's also apps for it on the Ubuntu Touch store, which lacks Proton apps, the notes are also great as is the RSS reader that I can sync.  Secondly, I have also began watching Attack on Titan again as my freind has been going on about it, I'm readig the Manga but it is so slow, so I'll probably keep watching the Anim√© which I like.  Christmas is in a few days and we break up tommorow which is pretty exiting and I'll see some family, I think I'm getting the <a href='https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/'>Raspberry Pi 5</a> which is cool.  Finally, I got the <a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/582160/Assassins_Creed_Origins/'>Assassins Creed Origins game</a> which I already had on PS4 but now I have on Steam because it was on sale, but I can't get it to work so I'll have to figure that out over the weekend, anyway, that is probably it for today.<br/>Fly You High - DeaDvey<br/><img src='https://searx.be/image_proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F236x%2Fc5%2F7f%2Fe1%2Fc57fe1d506c6a3aa53bd953199b7ea9f.jpg&h=60634c3b8432ca80d66386441593891a87a58ae6ec4810c40a64a665b0e677fc' height='200' alt='An image of Assassins Creed Origins' /><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/23551-Raspberry-Pi-5-8G-feature.jpg' height='200' alt='An image of a Raspberry Pi 5'/></p>

            <h1 class="blog-title">I didn't like Wordpress</h1>
            <p class="blog-content">So... Yeah, I didn't like wordpress very much, it's pretty clunky and I don't have much control over the webpage, and it's kinda not that fun to use, I'm glad I tried it out though because I kind of know how to use it know I suppose, I might copy over the wordpress back over to this so I can use it myself for fun I suppose.</p>
