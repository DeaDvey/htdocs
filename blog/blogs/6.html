                <h1 class="blog-title">Homemade laptop, Nextcloud and possible updates to website</h1>
                <p class="blog-content">This week I used my raspberry pi to make a Homemade laptop, for the case I used a cardboard box with a hinge duck taped to the back so it doesn't flop around.  I used a drawing tablet as a mouse as I had no spare mouse, the monitor is my phone conecting to the raspberry pi through VNC which is very janky and I used a massive portable charger to keep the phone and pi charged, the whole thing is really janky and I want to maybe get a 7 inch monitor for it which would work way better but, that's for the furture me.  I've found a cool new feature on Nextcloud called face recognition, I have not gotton it working though so I'll try figure that out, I suck at troubleshooting, it took like a week to figure out how to use occ, it's in the nextcloud root directory ._., there's also a map fearture which uses Open Street Maps to show where images where taken and when and also to plot addresses of your contacts which is very useful.  Finally, I was thinking of added a comment system to my blog posts, but don't know if I should as it could be vunerable and shit like that and I also can't really be bothered seeing as no one would use it... On the plus side I got Jotit working on my UBT phone because it needed a bloody / at the end of the address, WHY??? idk it just does for some reason.  Anyway, that's it for today.<br/> Fly You High - DeaDvey<br/></p>
