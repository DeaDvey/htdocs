                <h1 class="blog-title">Happy New Year!!!!</h1>
                <p class="blog-content">Firstly, Happy new year everyone, I was planning on doing this yesterday, but got distracted, I don't know about any of you, but mine is 1080p, I don't like 4K because I find things like the cursor don't scale well on a 4K monitor in KDE and in a tty the text is super small on 4K! Email me your new years resolutions, I'd love to know: <a href='mailto:email@deadvey.xyz'>email@deadvey.xyz</a>.  Secondly, I have discovered a new Terminal Emulator caleld <a href='https://github.com/borisfaure/terminology'>Terminology</a>, now it's quite heavy, so not really for anyone who likes lighter ones like Alacritty or Xterm, but it's really fancy and has optional backgrounds and overlays, and a cool bell that rings if you backspace too far back, I'm really liking it so far but we'll see, I also have installed a new font for my system which I'm using in Terminology called <a href='https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/'>Victor Mono</a> which is a monospaced font that has a nice subtle cursive style, I know that's kinda cursed but I really like it and Capital letters are non cursive so that they can be easier read.  I have found a small (7 inch) screen that is designed for the Raspberry Pi which I might get in order to make a custom laptop for my Pi which will be cool as the VNC route is extremly unstable and laggy as it's over WiFi, I'll have a think about it though and I'll consider the 8 Inch version.  My account has been accepted onto <a href='https://fossfarmers.company/a/deadvey8383'>Foss farmers Peertube Instance</a> so I'm now uploading to there, Check that out, though I am also uplaoding to <a href='/video'>My website</a>.  I have made a <a href='https://github.com/DeaDvey/node'>Github repo for the node js of this website</a> and so this whole site is now public on Github I have made a commit today, I added previous and next links to the blog pages, it checks first if  the post number is not equal to 0 (the first post) then if it is not, it adds a previous link, and if it is not the equal to the length of the array - 1 then it adds a next link, so I think I did it ok, that's in the makeblogs.js file.  Finally, I have gotten back into the <i>spirit</i> of revision for the exams coming up since the christmas break where I gave myself a rest, I did some pastpapers and maths today which was <i>fun</i>.  Okay, that's it for today, hope you have a good day!<br/>Fly You High - DeaDvey</p>
